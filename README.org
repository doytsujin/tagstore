This is an empty place holder for the source code of
http://tagstore.org

So far, tagstore is in a private SVN repository. It will be migrated
to here some time.

In the meanwhile, you can get the tool at [[http://tagstore.org][the homepage]]. Each download
option includes the Python sources as well.

Stay tuned!
