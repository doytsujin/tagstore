This is the source code of [[http://Karl-Voit.at/tagstore/]] which is a
research platform to test certain aspects of file tagging in Personal
Information Management.

The code of tagstore was developed 2010-2012 in a private SVN
repository. For the sake of reproducible research, the complete source
code history was scheduled to be migrated to here.

In the process of preparing the source code for the migration to
GitHub I noticed that the history of the repository does not have a
significant value since the latest and working version of tagstore
contains its source code for everybody. Additionally, five co-authors
wanted to stay anonymous. The other (non-anonymous) co-authors of this
repository are in alphabetic order:

- @geschob
- @mpirrer
- @novoid
- @thefriedc
- @wachjose88
- @wintersw

Additionally, you can get the tool with installer packages at [[http://Karl-Voit.at/tagstore/][the
homepage of the project]]. Each download option includes the Python
sources.

Feel free to use the code according to the attached license.

* README FOR TAGSTORE

This file is part of tagstore, an alternative way of storing and retrieving information.

This is a short description of how to configure and start the tagstore software.

** Starting tagstore

*** STEP 0: prerequisites

a) open a commandline shell

b) test if python is available on your system path:

: $python --version
: (expected output, where 2.5 or higher is fine)
: Python 2.5.0

if there is an output like this:

: python: command not found

please check your system PATH variable and your python installation


*** STEP 1: create a new store

a) run the tagstore_manager file:

: $/path_to_tagstore_installation/python tagstore_manager.py

OR

: $/path_to_tagstore_installation/tagstore_manager.py	(make sure the executable flag is set for this file)

the manager window should appear

b) create a new store.

  - select the tab "Store Management"
  - click the button "New Tagstore" and select a directory where you want to create your new tagstore.
  - please make sure this directory is empty, so there can be no troubles with already existing files there. you can create a new directory directly at the selection dialog if you want to.
  - the selected directory should now appear in the list below the "New Tagstore" button.

c) check if the creation of the tagstore was successful:
  - go to the previously selected directory. check if there are following sub-directories:
    : storage
    : navigation
    : categorization
    : expired_items

d) close the manager by clicking the "Save" button in the bottom right corner.


*** STEP 2: start the daemon

Just run the tagstore.py file in the same way you ran the =tagstore_manager= file (=$tagstore.py=)


** INFO: manually editing the store config file

Additional configuration of each store can be done by manually editing the =store.cfg= file
it is located in the dir: =$/path_to_store/.tagstore/store.cfg=

Each line in this line represents a configuration parameter. Just the listed parameters are ment to by changed manually:

*** show_category_line

There are 4 different settings:

- 0 ... show just the describing tagline
- 1 ... show the describing tagline AND a categorizing tagline - freely selectable categorizing tags
- 2 ... show the describing tagline AND a categorizing tagline - only restricted vocabulary is allowed
- 3 ... show just the categorizing tagline - only restricted vocabulary is allowed

*** category_mandatory

- true ... if there is a categorizing tagline available there MUST be at least one tag provided
- false ... the categorizing tagline can be left empty

** INFO: manually editing the application config file

General configuration of the tagstore application can be done by manually editing the =tagstore.cfg= file
it is located in the dir:
=$/path_to_tagstore_installation/tsresources/conf/store.cfg=

*** max_tags

Set the number of tags allowed to be used for tagging a single item
up to 6 tags can be computed within a reasonable time.

WARNING: using higher numbers of tags can lead to incredible high computation time.

*** num_popular_tags

Set the number of recent/popular describing tags which should be shown as decision help.

In the same directory where this file is located, there is a file called =tagstore.py=.
run =tagstore.py -h= for displaying optional starting parameters.


** Known bugs

- tagstore can not be installed and run from =C:\Program files=
  - Reason: tagstore needs writing permission to its config files
    which are located in the install directory

- tagstore can not be installed in a folder which starts with an
  underline (=_=)
